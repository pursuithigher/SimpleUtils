    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br/>

    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br/>

    made,<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br/>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as of the date such litigation is filed.<br/>
    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meet the following conditions:<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derivative Works a copy of this License;
    and<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stating that You changed the files; and<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that You distribute, all copyright, patent,
    trademark, and<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attribution notices from the Source form of the
    Work,<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;excluding those notices that do not pertain to
    any part of<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Derivative Works; and<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distribution, then any Derivative Works that You
    distribute must<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;include a readable copy of the attribution
    notices contained<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
    that do not<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in
    at least one<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the following places: within a NOTICE text
    file distributed<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as part of the Derivative Works; within the
    Source form or<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;documentation, if provided along with the
    Derivative Works; or,<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;within a display generated by the Derivative
    Works, if and<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wherever such third-party notices normally
    appear. The contents<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the NOTICE file are for informational
    purposes only and<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not modify the License. You may add Your own
    attribution<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;notices within Derivative Works that You
    distribute, alongside<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the
    Work, provided<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that such additional attribution notices cannot
    be construed<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as modifying the License.<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the conditions stated in this License.<br/>
    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/>
    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing
    the<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/>
    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
    conditions<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this
    License.<br/>
    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/>
    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/>
    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/>
